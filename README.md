# Animating Swift Changelog 5.1

Swift 5.1 brings with it a few major changes that really changes
the way we all will program with Swift going forward. 
There are quite a few "Whats new in Swift X.Y" playgrounds out there and 
I personally think they are great and each offer a different perspective on the 
new changes to the language and provide more insight so please use those playgrounds and 
resources as well as this, this is only one of many perspectives.


## Motivation
Apple's official ChangeLog is very concise and I enjoy reading it but wouldn't it 
be even better if you could read the changelog interactively and start writing and manipulating the examples right away?
This the simple idea behind Swift Live Changelog, its just that: a live version of [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Contributing 
Corrections and improvements to existing sections are more than welcome, just make the change inplace. 
To add a new `SE`  or `SR` item just add a new playground page with the new section.
I believe in giving credit where it is due so if you like you can add a section like this with a twitter and github handle
to the top of the playground page:

```swift
