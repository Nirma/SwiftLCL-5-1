 # Welcome
 
 Swift 5.1 brings with it a few major changes that really changes
 the way we all will program with Swift going forward.
 There are quite a few "Whats new in Swift X.Y" playgrounds out there and
 I personally think they are great and each offer a different perspective on the
 new changes to the language and provide more insight so please use those playgrounds and
 resources as well as this, this is only one of many perspectives.
 
 Apple's official ChangeLog is very concise and I enjoy reading it but wouldn't it
 be even better if you could read the changelog interactively and start writing and manipulating the examples right away?
 This the simple idea behind Swift Live Changelog, its just that: a live version of [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
